# What is Interaqt?


Interaqt is a project dedicated to separating application business logic from its specific implementation. It offers a revolutionary and rigorously structured data model for articulating business logic, alongside a suite of tools that automatically decide and implement software architecture based on this logic, directly providing usable APIs. Interaqt aims to liberate individuals and teams from the constraints of implementation specifics, performance requirements, and cost demands, allowing them to concentrate on the articulation of business logic and expedite application development. We also believe that this approach is optimal in the era of large language models (LLMs). Compared to generating code with LLMs, building intermediate data structures eliminates the uncertainty in generated systems, enabling true independence from engineering involvement unless specific capabilities are required.
